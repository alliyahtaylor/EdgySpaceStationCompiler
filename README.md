# EdgySpaceStationCompiler
A Babylon 5 / Deep Space 9 themed compiler written in Typescript.


Setup TypeScript
=====================

1. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/), if you don't already have it

Your Workflow
=============

To compile, run "npm run dev" in this directory in your terminal.
The command will automatically watch for any changes in .ts files and compile it for you.

Running
=============
1. Open index.html in the browser. (I recommend Chrome, personally.)
